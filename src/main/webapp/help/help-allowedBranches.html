<div>
    Source branches allowed to trigger a build from a <b>Push event</b>. Multiple selections possible with Ctrl-click.
   If all branches are unselected then no filtering will occur. However if the configuration is reopened all branches
   will be marked as allowed and then any new branches will be filtered. Therefore if no filtering is desired it is
   best to leave this option unchecked.
